============================
Auxiliary immunogold scripts
============================

These are auxiliary Python scripts, to be used with the family of analysis 
tools I have written for analysis of immunogold labeled electron micrographs. 

- add_random.py is used to add random points to coordinate files.
- change_scale.py is used to change the scale of coordinate files.

for more information.
